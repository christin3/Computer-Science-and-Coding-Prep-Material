# Computer-Science-and-Coding-Prep-Material
Compiling a list of useful material that I have reviewed or used to learn more about the fundamentals of Computer Science! 

# Resources
You will find the appropriate thank you and link to the original authors material with their associated files 

# Reason Behind This 
Since taking a 6 month course at UT Austin's Coding Bootcamp and learning how to code full-stack applications, I wanted to start brush up on theories behind computer science.  I want to learn more about Algorithm Development, Big O notation, OOP, Data Structures and Discrete Structures.
