What is a data structure?
    - They are built upon simpler primitive data types (like variables)
    - A way of storing data so that it can be used efficiently by the computer or browser.
    - They are non-opinionated, in the sense, that they are just responsible for holding the        data.

What are Arrays
    - Indexed data, javascript allows a mix of types in the arrays
    - Array size can be adjusted accordingly and is not fixed

Stacks
    - Last in first out, top is accessible first.
    - push, pop, peek, isEmpty, clear


Linked Lists
    - like a train, each cart knows its position and the position of the cart in           front of it

What is a data structure?

What does FIFO and LIFO stand for and mean?
    First in first out
    Last in first out

What is a Stack?
    Stack follow a last in first out structure

What is a Queue?
    like an array but they only allow access to the first element
    Queues follow a First in first out structure


What is a Linked List?
    each element is joined with the next element
    they can keep track of the position of the elements with points
    each element is a node, tracks its own position and the one in front of it
    doubly linked list can point forwards and backwards


How are they each different from arrays?
    arrays are stored in a mem block

What is one disadvantage of an array?


Most important question: Why are we doing all this again?

Dictionaries (Maps) new in ES6

var map = new Map();
map.set("cat","dog");

    - In a way, dictionaries serve as a hybrid between objects and arrays.
    - They can be iterated over like arrays.
    - They have key, value pairs like objects.

Trees
    - Trees are a non-sequential data structure made of parent-child relationships.
    - The top node of a tree is the root
    - Trees have internal nodes and external nodes
    - Each node has ancestors and descendants
    - Leaf node is a node that does not have any children

Graphs
    - Nodes and edges where information can be put on either, like a tree but no          restriction on children
    - Graphs are abstract models of a network structure. They are a set of nodes (or        vertices) connected by edges.
    - They are the essence of social networks and geographic maps.
